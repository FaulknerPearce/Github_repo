# Binary Search: Number Guessing Game

## Description
"Median" is a command-line script that implements a number-guessing game using a binary search-like strategy. The program attempts to guess a number chosen by the user within a range of 0 to 100. It narrows down the possibilities by calculating medians and adjusting the bounds based on the user's responses.

## Features
- Interactive guessing game experience.
- Utilizes binary search principles to efficiently narrow down the range of possible numbers.
- Provides prompts for the user to indicate whether the guessed number is below or above their chosen number.
- Limits the number of guesses to a maximum of 11.
- Provides a result at the end of the game, indicating whether the program successfully guessed the number or not.

## How to Use
1. Run the "Median" script in a Python environment.
2. Follow the prompts to choose a number between 0 and 100.
3. The program will make guesses and prompt you to confirm if the guessed number is correct or provide feedback if it needs to guess again.
4. Respond to the prompts by entering 1 for "yes" or 2 for "no" and 1 for "below" or 2 for "above."
5. The program will continue to guess until it finds the correct number or reaches the maximum number of tries.
6. Once the game ends, the program will display the result, indicating whether it successfully guessed the number or not.
