# Data Structures

Explore a collection of fundamental data structures implemented in various programming languages. Understanding data structures is vital for writing efficient and organized code.

## Subfolders

### 1. HashMap

Introduces a HashMap data structure with functions for assigning key-value pairs and retrieving values, considering collisions.

### 2. Stacks

Includes a stack data structure 
with basic operations like push, pop, and peek, plus an optional custom limit for stack size.

### 3. Queues

Comprises a queue data structure 
with operations like enqueue, dequeue, and peek, along with an optional custom maximum size for the queue.

### 4. Linked Lists

Contains both singly and doubly linked list implementations,
with features such as adding and removing nodes, finding nth last nodes, finding the middle element, and swapping nodes.

## Usage
