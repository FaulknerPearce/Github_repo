# Delayed Print Script

## Overview

The Delayed Print Script is a simple Python script that provides a delayed printing effect to text output in the terminal. It utilizes the `time` and `sys` modules to slowly print messages to the terminal.

## Features

### 1. Delayed Printing
- The script features a delayed_print() function that prints an input message to the terminal character by character with a specified delay. This creates a gradual, visually engaging output.

### 2. Delayed User Input
- The delayed_input() function prints a message to the terminal in a delayed manner and then waits for user input. This can be used to enhance the interactive aspect of a script or game.

## Functions 

`delayed_print(text, delay=0.04)`
- This function slowly prints an input message to the terminal, character by character, with a specified delay. It enhances the visual presentation of text output.

`delayed_input(text)`
- This function slowly prints an input message to the terminal and then waits for user input. The delayed printing adds a visual touch to user interaction.
