# Proof of Work Algorithm

## Overview
This script implements a simple proof of work algorithm using SHA256 hashing. It takes a list of transactions and a difficulty level as input, and returns a hash that has the required amount of leading zeros.
Overall, this code provides a basic implementation of proof of work. However, it is important to note that this implementation is not secure and should not be used in production environments.

## Features
